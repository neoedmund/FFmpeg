FFmpeg README
=============

FFmpeg is a collection of libraries and tools to process multimedia content
such as audio, video, subtitles and related metadata.

## Libraries

* `libavcodec` provides implementation of a wider range of codecs.
* `libavformat` implements streaming protocols, container formats and basic I/O access.
* `libavutil` includes hashers, decompressors and miscellaneous utility functions.
* `libavfilter` provides means to alter decoded audio and video through a directed graph of connected filters.
* `libavdevice` provides an abstraction to access capture and playback devices.
* `libswresample` implements audio mixing and resampling routines.
* `libswscale` implements color conversion and scaling routines.

## Tools

* [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html) is a command line toolbox to
  manipulate, convert and stream multimedia content.
* [ffplay](https://ffmpeg.org/ffplay.html) is a minimalistic multimedia player.
* [ffprobe](https://ffmpeg.org/ffprobe.html) is a simple analysis tool to inspect
  multimedia content.
* Additional small tools such as `aviocat`, `ismindex` and `qt-faststart`.

# neoe: about lyrics

I tried with `ffplay -f lavfi -i "color=c=0x777777@0.2:duration=99999999999:size=1280x720:rate=30, subtitles=aaa.lrc [out1]; amovie=aaa.opus [out0]"`

* the subtitle(lyrics) not wrap
* the duration is not good with seeking

maybe all can be solved by tweak the option of ffplay,
but, I feel I'd like to add my very own code here.

the lyrics interface is :
* open (filename)
* position(pos)
* seeked()
* finished()
